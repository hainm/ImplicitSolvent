Solvation Energy calculation with different Generalized Born solvent models
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Those are Python scripts for my graduate work. (those scripts were written about 6 years ago (and changed a bit this year), so the writing is very ugly. But they did what they were supposed to do)

Aim:
* Calculate solvent energies with GB-HCT, GB-OBC, GB-Neck, GB-Neck2 model. (you can do this with sander/pmemd in AMBER too)
* Process AMBER topology and do a bunch of stuff. Please see the inside code.

Check: `./GB/GBClass.py`
and    `./Examples/`
